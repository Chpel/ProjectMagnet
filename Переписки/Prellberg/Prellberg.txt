Hi Evgeni,

 

The below is all for J=0:

 

I’ve done some simple number crunching that leads me to ask you the following: can you exclude from your simulations the estimates

n_2=0.7177, n_3=0.2271, and n_4=0.0553 for the fraction of monomers with 2, 3, and 4 neighbours, respectively, in the thermodynamic limit?

 

My simulations indicate that the finite-size estimates for the first of these would decrease, and for the second and third would increase as length becomes larger. I don’t see how you would get n_2=0.75.

 

But to some extend I’m comparing apples with pears here: I take my end-point estimates p_k, disregard p_0 and compute as a proxy

 

n_2=p_3/(p_1+p_2+p_3)

n_3=p_2/(p_1+p_2+p_3)

n_4=p_1/(p_1+p_2+p_3)

 

However, I don’t see why this would be that wrong for very long walks.

 

Finally, one can prove (using pattern theorems) that n_4 is strictly positive in the thermodynamic limit. For a reference see
