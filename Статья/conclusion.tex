\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:end}
This paper focused on the critical geometrical properties of Ising-ISAW model, such as mean asphericity of the conformation, aspect ratio, and proportion the monomers with fixed number of the nearest neighbors, proportion the monomers with fixed number of the nearest neighbors, on the several lattices. 
The results of shape factors of 2D-square Ising-ISAW model were compared with the results of research of the Rectangular Ising model \cite{Selke2006}, in attempt to find universal magnetic properties in the critical area. 
The comparison of the observed models showed complete dissimilarity of critical bevaviour of magnetic properties between them.

The new metric of compaction of confromation - proportion the monomers with fixed number of the nearest neighbors - showed clear features of extended and swollen states of conformations between the $\theta$-transition. 
The metric also indicates the first-order phase transition for cubic model and the continuous type of transition on the triangle lattice, which clearly correlates with the results in \cite{Foster2021, faizullina2021critical}

Found differencies between models showed that both models can be equally useful in random walk based algorithms with the accent on local coordination number. 
In sociology both models can be applied as different strategies for analysis of connections in social networks.

Further work can be directed in researching the another case of local coordination number, such as atmosphere of SAW-conformation, defined as a number of free lattices nodes near the end of conformation.
