\begin{abstract}
The study focuses on a model on a magnetic polymer chain with closely interacting Ising spins on a lattices with different numbers of dimensions d: square and triangular with d=2, and cubic with d=3. The studied model has dynamic disorder for both spins and conformations, and fixed length of a chain. The shape factors of conformations are considered as geometrical critical observables which can correlate with aspect ratio as a parameter of regular Ising model. The binder cumulant of both models in their respective critical areas with same shape factors are expected to be equal. The mean fraction of monomers on a chain with fixed number of neighbors (or bulks) are considered as a geometric measure of compaction of conformation. Using Monte-Carlo methods in Worm-Algorithm, we compare these measures between chains with respective spin-to-spin coupling constant J in lattices having equal number of highest possible number of monomers.
