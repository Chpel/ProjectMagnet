	abstract = {Self-interacting walks and polygons on the simple cubic lattice undergo a collapse transition at the -point. We consider self-avoiding walks and polygons with an additional interaction between pairs of vertices which are unit distance apart but not joined by an edge of the walk or polygon. We prove that these walks and polygons have the same limiting free energy if the interactions between nearest-neighbour vertices are repulsive. The attractive interaction regime is investigated using Monte Carlo methods, and we find evidence that the limiting free energies are also equal here. In particular, this means that these models have the same -point, in the asymptotic limit. The dimensions and shapes of walks and polygons are also examined as a function of the interaction strength.}

	abstract = {We consider polymers made of magnetic monomers (Ising or Heisenberg-like) in a good solvent. These polymers are modeled as self-avoiding walks on a cubic lattice, and the ferromagnetic interaction between the spins carried by the monomers is short-ranged in space. At low temperature, these polymers undergo a magnetic induced first order collapse transition, that we study at the mean field level. Contrasting with an ordinary Θ point, there is a strong jump in the polymer density, as well as in its magnetization. In the presence of a magnetic field, the collapse temperature increases, while the discontinuities decrease. Beyond a multicritical point, the transition becomes second order and Θ-like. Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising case are in qualitative agreement with these results.},
